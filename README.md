# ProOS
ProOS (Shorot for Programming OS) is a mockup operating system made in various languages such as C, Bash, and Python. I'm making this purely for fun and not for actual purpose, and I will likely use it to practice my coding skills in different languages.
This will most likely support Windows in the future, however at the moment I'm just a single person writing this, so dont expect ports soon. Currently it only works for Linux.
Requirements:
- GNU Linux
- GCC and Python3
- A lot of programming knowlege.
